# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## More we know
'''
when we use map function like        map( () => {} )
{highlightsSlides.map(      (slide, index) => ()     )}
when we use () instead of {} after => it is called immediate return / automatic retrun and it is used when we want to return something immediately without writing return keyword.
